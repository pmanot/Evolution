# evolution

An attempt to allow people to run small scale simulations on their ios devices, to watch and observe different species in a neutral environment
compete for food, and watch as the mix of species "evolves" by slowly leaning in favor of simple traits (speed, size, etc) that help them survive.
I also hope to expand this into a epidemic simulator, by simulating small societies and giving people a more visual representation of how diseases spread
alongside the raw data to help people really visualise chaos theory and how individual random behaviour, in a group can still lead to some prominent
and unexpected patterns.

The beauty and elegance of a "cell" is that visually, it is so very simple to look at, and yet it can hold so much information. Its color, size, movement, 
opacity, etc. can all be used as visual tools to help better grasp some very fundamental numbers that govern its traits, while also being able to see and roughly
grasp how there traits slowly mutate and change in a collection of these "cells" and how the group or collection slowly "evloves" to only allow the survival of
the most efficient cells based on the environmental constraints.

Inspired by channels such as 3blue1brown (youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) and Primer (youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ), I hope this proves as a useful and playfull tool to help understand the underlying complexities
of group behaviour and changes while being able to visually express seemingly arbitrary numbers that can be played around with to help show people how beautiful
relationship between the actions an individual and a group is when put in an environment with some form of constraints
